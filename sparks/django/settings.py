    """ Returns the first existing settings file, out of:

        - the one specified in the environment
          variable :env:`SPARKS_DJANGO_SETTINGS`,
        - one constructed from either the full hostname,
          then the host shortname (without TLD), then only
          the domain name. If the current hostname is short
          from the start (eg. :file:`/etc/hostname` contains
          a short name only), obviously only one will be tried.
        - a :file:`default` configuration eg.
          a :file:`settings/default.py` file.

        If none of these files are to be found, a :class:`RuntimeError`
        will be raised.

        These files will be looked up in the same directy as the caller.
        To acheive this, use them like this:

            project/
                settings/
                    __init__.py
                    myhostname_domain_ext.py
                    otherhost_domain_ext.py
                    special-config.py

        In the file :file:`__init__.py`: just write:

            from sparks.django.settings import find_settings()
            execfile(find_settings(__file__))

        The :file:`myhostname_domain_ext.py` and others are completely
        standard settings file. You are free to use them as you like, eg.
        plain Django settings files, or combined in any way that pleases
        you. You could for example create a :file:`common.py`, import it
        in all other, and override only a part of its attributes in them.

        .. note:: hostname related operations are done lower-case, and dots
            are replaced with underscores. If your hostname is
            ``Chani.Licorn.local``, `sparks` will search
            ``chani_licorn_local``, ``chani`` and ``licorn_local``.

        .. note:: if you hostname starts with a digit, there is no problem
            regarding the current function: the setting filename can start
            with a digit, because it will not be imported
            but :func:`execfile`ed and in this particular case, Python
            will not complain, like it would have done for a module name.
